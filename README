ecwid-seo
=========
ecwid_catalog.php: all ajax-content building functionality
ecwid_product_api.php: Ecwid product API wrapper
ecwid_platform.php: contains platform-specific functions. They are to be redefined in WordPress, Joomla etc., and for a standalone version these are used
ecwid_misc.php: other functions
run.php: the code that actually runs the processing. Since the original script produced its output into php variables, we also need that run code
build.php: compiles all files into one. php build.php > ecwid_ajax_indexing.php produces a compiled file with that name


tests/ are simple PHPUnit tests based on my demo store data. They do not cover all functionality now, the purpose for them was to make sure nothing crashes while performing the changes. In tests/common_includes.php you can switch between testing a compiled version or separate files. Note that you can not run all tests at once for a compiled version since it produces "Cannot redeclare function" errors
